<h1>Uploading Data</h1>
You may upload recored data to OpenSeaMap to help improve the bathymetric model and to receive good charts with rendered depths in return.<br>

If you do not have a depth data account create one at the <a href="http://depth.openseamap.org#register">website</a>.<br>
You may then create a vessel configuration that holds the length draught and other parameters of your vessel on the webpage.
<br>

Switch back to the Wizard and enter your account credentials.<br>
