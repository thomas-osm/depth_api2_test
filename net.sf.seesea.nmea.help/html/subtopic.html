<h1>Visualization</h1>
The application provides you with three views. 
<h2>Sensor Data View</h2>
The Sensor Data view shows the interpreted bus data such as the current position or available satellites and their signal strengths.
If the provider does not provide data for more than three seconds the data will be crossed out and faded.

<h2>Chart View</h2>
The Chart View shows the recorded track and measured depths on a map. It uses OpenStreetMap Data from its main server to visualize your current location.
The OpenStreetMap data is being cached on your local disk so you do not need to have an internet connection available to visualize the data.  

<h2>Bus System Raw Data Log</h2>
The Bus System Raw Data Log shows the last 1000 raw NMEA data sentences as they are received. If you can read the matrix then this is your view.
