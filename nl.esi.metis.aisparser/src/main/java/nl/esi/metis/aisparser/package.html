This package supports the parsing of AIS messages.
AIS, the Automatic Identification System, is a system aiming at improving maritime safety by exchanging messages between ships, 
other vehicles in particular aircraft involved in search-and-rescue (SAR), and (fixed) base stations.
The standard documents describing AIS can be found <a href=http://www.itu.int/rec/R-REC-M.1371-4-201004-I/en>here</a>.

See class {@link nl.esi.metis.aisparser.AISParser AISParser} for more information on how to use this package.

See the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/p/esiaisparser/wiki/ESI AIS Parser License/">ESI AIS Parser License</a> for more information on the legal aspects.
<p>
The parser was used in the <a href="http://www.esi.nl/poseidon/">Poseidon project</a>,
and is improved in the <a href="http://www.esi.nl/metis/">Metis project</a> to better handle uncertain information.
Both projects were led by the <a href="http://www.esi.nl">Embedded Systems Institute</a>.
In both projects <a href="http://www.thalesgroup.nl">Thales Nederlands</a> was the carrying industrial partner, 
and multiple Dutch universities participated.
